# LABNet: A Lightweight Attentive Beamforming Network for Ad-hoc Multichannel Microphone Invariant Real-Time Speech Enhancement

## Abstract
Multichannel speech enhancement (SE) aims to restore clean speech from noisy measurements by leveraging spatiotemporal signal features. In ad-hoc array conditions, microphone invariance (MI) requires systems to handle different microphone numbers and array geometries. From a practical perspective, multichannel recordings inevitably increase the computational burden for edge-device applications, highlighting the necessity of lightweight and efficient deployments. In this work, we propose a lightweight attentive beamforming network (LABNet) to integrate MI in a low-complexity real-time SE system. We design a three-stage framework for efficient intra-channel modeling and inter-channel interaction. A cross-channel attention module is developed to aggregate features from each channel selectively. Experimental results demonstrate our LABNet achieves impressive performance with ultra-light resource overhead while maintaining the MI, indicating great potential for ad-hoc array processing.
